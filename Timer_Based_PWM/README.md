# PWM Using Timers

This project demonstrates the generation of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals using timers. The implementation allows for PWM generation at any pin, without relying on dedicated PWM output pins.

## Description

The project uses two timers to control the PWM wave shape. It adjusts the duty cycle in a loop, enabling smooth transitions in PWM output. Adjusting the duty cycle using interrupts.
