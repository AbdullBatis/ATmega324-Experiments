# ATmega324-Experiments

My projects and experiments using the ATmega324 microcontroller. This repository includes firmware development, peripheral interfacing, and embedded system applications.

## Project List

- **Project 1: ADC with LCD Display**  
  - Description: Implements ADC and displays the converted value on a 16x2 LCD.

- **Project 2: 7-Segment Display Control**  
  - Description: Controls a 7-segment display, incrementing the number from 0 to 9 with button presses.

- **Project 3: Timer Overflow with Interrupts**  
  - Description: Uses Timer1 interrupts to toggle an LED.

- **Project 4: PWM Generation Using Timers**  
  - Description: Implements PWM generation using timers without relying on dedicated PWM pins. This project demonstrates duty cycle adjustment and waveform shaping using Timer1 and Timer0.

- **Project 5: Keypad Input with LCD**  
  - Description: Reads user input from a 4x4 keypad and displays the pressed key on a 16x2 LCD. This project serves as a prototype for user interface testing.
